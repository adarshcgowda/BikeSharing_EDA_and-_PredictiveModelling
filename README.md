# BikeSharing_EDA_and-_PredictiveModelling

Excited to share my latest project diving deep into bike sharing data! From exploratory analysis to predictive modeling, uncovering insights that pedal us towards a better understanding of ridership trends and future possibilities.

Background:

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position.
Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Problem :

This dataset contains the hourly count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Perform Exploratory data analysis to consist of a short analysis and build a prediction model for the hourly utilization “cnt” and provide recommendations for business processes and operational strategy.

Outcome:

Peak Business Hours: the peak business hours, are between 7 - 9 AM and 4 - 7 PM significance of these hours for the business and potential opportunities for service enhancement can be stormed.

Weekday Analysis:The observation of weekdays shows nearly equal rental counts (280). Possibility on strategies for targeting different customer segments on weekdays.

Holiday Rentals:The rentals are comparatively higher on holidays. Recommended on marketing initiatives to capitalize on holiday demand.

The business and operational strategy could be performed to optimize the overall performance.
